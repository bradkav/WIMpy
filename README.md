# WIMpy

Python code for doing fits to (mock) dark matter direct detection data.

The basic structure is that `Experiment` defines a class which describes a given detector (whose properties are described in files such as those in `DDexpt_examples`).

The `DMUtils` module then contains code for calculating event rates in direct detection experiments.

Further details of how the code works will be uploaded soon!
